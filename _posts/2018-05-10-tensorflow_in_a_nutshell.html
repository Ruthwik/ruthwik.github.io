<p>TensorFlow is a multipurpose Opensource software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. It is originally developed by Google Brain Team to conduct deep neural networks research. TensorFlow is written in Python, C++ and CUDA. It provides stable Python API,C APIs and without backwards compatability gaurantee  C++, Go, Java, JavaScript and Swift. TensorFlow is applied in a wide variety of domains as well. Here is an example project named Magenta. Magenta is a project devoted to music and art generation with machine intelligence. The following figure shows how Tensorflow is used to help the user draw a picture.

<p> In this tutorial I	will cover the very	basics of TensorFlow. Deep learning will be covered in a different post. I will be using TensorFlow's Python API to explain.	

<h3>Installing TensorFlow</h3> 
<p>TensorFlow is a library and it can be installed like any other library using <code>pip</code> command.
<ul>
  <li>Install python 3.6 and above. Download from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads//">here.</a></p></li>
  <li>Install Tensorflow <pre><code class="language-python">
		pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
 </code></pre></li>
</ul>
Note: We will be using TensorFlow with CPU support only. If you have supporting GPU then please see these <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/">instructions.</a>
</p>
<p>
In algebra, the points which are (x,y) pairs can be plotted on the Cartesian coordinate system and also a straight line on the Cartesian coordinate system
 has the equation y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept of the line. 
 In other terms y = estimated dependent variable , m is the feature weights, b = bias term, and x = score on the independent variable.
  </p>

 <p>Let's rewrite the equation for more than one independent variables</p>
 
 <p>
 where
 <ul>
  <li>n is the number of features</li>
  <li>x<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> feature </li>
  <li>m<sub>i</sub> is the i<sup>th</sup> model parameter</li>
</ul>

If you want to know the detail maths behind Linear Regression, some great resources are provided at the end of this tutorial.

<h3>Implementation</h3> 
<p>
In our first attempt to learn ML algorithms using scikit, we will implement Linear Regression to predict prices of stocks.  
In this example we will use apple stock prices for 1 year which can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/Ruthwik/StockPrediction/blob/master/Data/StockDataSet.csv">here</a>.
You can try with any other stock which is available at <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aapl/historical">nasdaq</a>.
</p> 
<p>Let's get started.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will import the required libraries which includes: Scikit, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruthwik/21630947bbaf864e8bd8cebaf8433a01.js"></script>
</p>

<p>Now, lets see the steps for preparing the dataset for Linear Regression model training. 
Firstly, we import the stock dataset file using pandas library method <code>pd.read_csv</code> to pandas dataframe. 
Second, converting the date into numeric value using time and date python library. We can also convert date into different columns like day,month and year
 but for our simplicity of one feature let's just convert into numeric value. 
 The third one is to convert the pandas dateframe into numpy array using <code>np.array()</code>. The linear model of scikit accepts only numpy array.
 The last one is to reshape the numpy arrays to n X 1 shape. The <code>reshape()</code> method will reshape the features so that it will be feed to scikit library. 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruthwik/1f6153eef33cf30a20693ce1101a80d7.js"></script>
</p>	

<p>We will now divide the dataset into two parts for training and testing. Scikit provides <code>train_test_split(*arrays, **options)</code> to split the dataset.
By default, test_size value is set to 0.25 and train_size value is set to 0.75. We can change these values according to our needs.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruthwik/c5e09ec6b1ddf56873847071dbaff058.js"></script>
</p>

<p>Our next step is to visualize the dataset for data insights. Although our dataset is a simple one, it is a good practise to visualize the data.Using Matplotlib we can plot the graph</p>
<img src="/img/stockdataset_visualize.png" alt="date vs. price"/>

<p>Linear Regression implementation is pretty straight forward in scikit. 
Two lines of code is all that is required. First line will fit the the training data into the linear regression model. 
The second line is to use the trained model to predict.Now we have a trained Linear Regression model. We are now able to make predictions on unseen data
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Ruthwik/d93ddba6dedda504789796718967901d.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
How would we know whether our model is good enough? For that we calculate coefficient of determination.
<i>R<sup>2</sup> is a statistic that will give some information about the goodness of fit of a model. 
In regression, the R<sup>2</sup>  coefficient of determination is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the real data points. 
An R<sup>2</sup> of 1 indicates that the regression line perfectly fits the data.</i>. <code>linear_model_.score(X, y)</code> gives us the score. 
Our training data score is 0.785 and testing data score is 0.787. Training and testing scores will give us information about model overfitting and underfitting.
If the model performs well during training (training score) and underperforms during testing (testing score) then the model is <i>overfiting</i>. If the model doesn't perform 
well during training or testing then the model is <i>underfitting</i>. Our model is performing decently well.

</p>
<p>
Now, let's plot the trained Linear Regression model. The plot below also showing the prices of apple stock and the learned regression line.

</p>
<p>
Before concluding let's predict the price of the apple stock on a given day.
